# Fourier fun

Use Fourier transforms to generate epicycles to follow the edges of an image. Apply common CV techniques to extract edges from any given image.

## TODOs

Implement an SVG parser. Since SVGs are defined by equations, we could bypass the CV parts of the code. The results would be smoother but also more limited since most images you find will be a non-vectorized format such as PNG.
